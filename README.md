# Hai!

#### 👩‍💻 I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for all things tech
#### 💻 I thrive at the intersection of maximalism, troubleshooting, and aesthetics
#### 💅I strongly believe that science - and specifically computer science - can be both girly-pop and serious.
#### 🔍 Since diving into the world of Computer Science, I've been loading myself up on bootcamps, internships, and extracurriculars in order to learn and improve myself
#### 📚 When I'm not working on code, at my full time job, or doing extracurriculars, you'll often find me exploring topics like data hoarding, virtual reality, and hunting for great deals on used items - there's nothing quite like the thrill of finding a steal! 
#### 🌈 On my time off, I love reading fantasy, anime, video games, watching videos, and hanging out with my loved ones and my pets.
