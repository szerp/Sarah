# ✨ Hai There! ✨

#### 👩‍💻 I’m a Computer Science student enchanted by all things tech!
#### 💻 Living at the sparkly crossroads of maximalism, troubleshooting, and aesthetics.
#### 💅 Firm believer that Computer Science is not just serious business — it can be girly-pop too!
#### 🔍 My journey into the tech world has been a whirlwind of bootcamps, internships, and all the fun extracurriculars. I’m always on the move, learning and leveling-up my skills!
#### 📚 When I'm not diving into code, working my magic at my job, or brightening up extracurriculars, you’ll catch me hoarding data like treasures, dipping into virtual reality, and scoring the best deals on pre-loved gems—because who doesn’t love a great find?
#### 🌈 In my downtime, I’m all about escaping into fantasy worlds, binge-watching anime, conquering video games, and soaking up fun and educational/techy vids. Also, I love spending time with my senior dogs. 

##### 💖 Let’s make the digital world dazzle 💖
